          Dear chellame,<br><br>
          I understand you are upset with me as the efforts and thoughtfulness from me has decreased pattu..üòî
          I have not been putting much efforts into the relationship lately, I have not been doing thoughtful things, which is totally my fault. I see where you are coming from my love üíï. All this slipped out of my mind pattu, which certainly does not mean I don't love you!! And I know my trauma is not an "excuse" for the way I reacted pattu. I'm very sorry my love‚ù§Ô∏è 
          I'm truly sorry that I was not able to put efforts in the relationship for the past week as much, there was a lot for me to take in, and I did not think of thoughtful things to do, nor make cute surprises, I did not basically do thoughtful things at all, I am very sorry pattu, I apologize honey.  
          In the future, no matter what it is, I will find thoughtful things to do that will keep the relationship's spark alive, no matter how small. I will increase the amount of efforts I am putting on you chellame, <br> Because I can give you the whole multiverses but it still won't be enough, because I know what you are worthy of, my dearest ‚ù§Ô∏è but sometimes I fail to provide as something little as a galaxy. My dear baby, I will not fail again, I will not let you down *hugs u vv tightly*
          
          <br>
          I love you honey ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
          I adore you pattu ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
          <br>
          <br>

          Idho, inga paaru? kosu iruku paaru ennoda cheek la.. *shows u my cheek*<br><br>
          Always yours<br>Unnoda slow boyfriendüò≠<br>
